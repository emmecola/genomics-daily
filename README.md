Genomics Daily is an automated tool that retrieves and summarizes the latest genomics publications from major scientific journals. The script:
- Searches for publications based on predefined keywords listed in `keywords.txt`
- Filters publications from a curated list of journals listed in `journals.txt`
- Retrieves papers published within the last 24 hours
- Utilizes [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic to generate summaries of the most relevant papers

## Features

This script retrieves the genomics publications that were recently published in major scientific journals. The keywords and the journals considered are respectively listed in files `keywords.txt` and `journals.txt`. By default, the papers published in the last 24 hours are retrieved. The papers are then processed by [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic, which prints a summary of the three most relevant papers.

1. Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/emmecola/genomics-daily.git
    cd genomics-daily
    ```
2. Install [`anthropic`](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/), [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) libraries.
