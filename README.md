Genomics Daily is an automated tool that retrieves and summarizes the latest genomics publications from major scientific journals. The script:
- Searches for publications based on predefined keywords listed in `keywords.txt`
- Filters publications from a curated list of journals listed in `journals.txt`
- Retrieves papers published within the last day
- Utilizes [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic to generate summaries of the most relevant papers
